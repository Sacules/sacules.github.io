<p>My experience with dwm started as an interest in tiling window managers - had previously tried i3, but never got comfortable with the keybindings. When I found about the whole suckless project, the idea of a simpler WM that offered tiling and was very light made me interested in trying it on an older netbook I had.</p>

<p>Since I had no clue on how to patch it, found an interesting fork on github that had some patches I was interested in. Some months later I got tired of it and chose to go all the way to patching dwm myself, and getting the settings I wanted.</p>

<p>And there came the idea of documenting the process, albeit a little late, but better now before I forget the details. The following is a rough guide to patching and customizing dwm, and how to deal with some of the minor details. For a beginner&rsquo;s guide, see the excellent <a href="http://ratfactor.com/slackware/dwm/">Dave&rsquo;s Visual Guide to dwm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notice</strong>: I&rsquo;m using the git version of dwm, which is slightly different and I recommend above the stable versions since it has several fixes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve applied the following patches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tilegap</li>
<li>Statuscolors</li>
<li>Systray</li>
<li>Scratchpad</li>
<li>Pertag</li>
<li>Cfacts</li>
<li>Bottomstack layout (with custom gaps)</li>
<li>Attachaside</li>
<li>Clear layout</li>
<li>Status bar padding</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="colors">Colors</h1>

<p>The easiest part: colors are defined as strings, using an RGB format, and are arrays of characters.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-c">
static const char normbordercolor[] = "#393f45";
    </code>
</pre>

<p>The name doesn&rsquo;t matter, and you can have a many colors defined as you like. What&rsquo;s important is where you put them on the colors array:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-c">
static const char *colors[][3]      = {
    /*               fg         bg         border   */
    [SchemeNorm] = { normfgcolor,   normbgcolor,   normbordercolor, },
    [SchemeSel]  = { selfgcolor,    selbgcolor,    selbordercolor , },
    [SchemeUrg] =  { urgfgcolor,    urgbgcolor,    urgbordercolor },
};
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Let me explain what each of these means:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[SchemeNorm]</code> holds the colors used for the inactive windows and tags, <code>fg</code> being the color of words or icons that define each tag, <code>bg</code>the background of each, and <code>border</code> the one for inactive windows.</li>
<li><code>[SchemeSel]</code>, same idea as before, but for selected windows and tags. In my config I&rsquo;ve set the background of both to be the same and only change the foreground color.</li>
<li><code>[SchemeUrg]</code> is an interesting scheme, used for notifications and warnings - for example, having Firefox open in one tag, and in another tag I open a link, the tag containing Rirefox will change its colors.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the sake of consistency, I stick to the colorscheme of my terminal (at the time of writing this, base16 Ashes).</p>

<h1 id="fonts">Fonts</h1>

<p>dwm has this very cool feature called <strong>font fallback</strong> which allows you to define several fonts, and if the first one can&rsquo;t display a character correctly, then dwm will try to  use the following font, and so on. This could be useful if you have a font that doesn&rsquo;t support glyphs or unicode characters, but still want to be able to display them.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-c">
static const char *fonts[] = { "SauceCodePro Nerd Font:size=9:width=1" };
    </code>
</pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen that some people have had performance issues with some of the <a href="link">Nerd Fonts</a>, and this method has allowed them to prevent that. Haven&rsquo;t had such problems so ended up putting just one font.</p>

<h1 id="tags">Tags</h1>

<p>Similarly to the concept of several workspaces, dwm incorporates tags, which are like tabs were you can put your windows in. What&rsquo;s interesting tho, is the ability of combining several of these tags - that is, displaying the windows of several at once. By default, they&rsquo;re named from 1 to 9, but you can change that for any text or unicode icon you like - I think there&rsquo;s no minimum beyond 1 tag, but I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s a limit of how many dwm can deal with.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-c">
static const char *tags[] = { "", "", "", "", "" };
    </code>
</pre>

<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>

<p>We can also define how certain programs will behave - this is handy to quickly set up the ones we use a lot, and be certain that, for example, Firefox will always open on the fourth tag of our third monitor and will always be floating no matter what.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-c">
static const Rule rules[] = {
    /* xprop(1):
     *  WM_CLASS(STRING) = instance, class
     *  WM_NAME(STRING) = title
     */
    /* class      instance    title       tags mask     isfloating   monitor */
    { "Gimp",     NULL,       NULL,       0,            1,           -1 },
    { "Firefox",  NULL,       NULL,       0,            0,           -1 },
};
    </code>
</pre>

<p>A far more detailed explanation of how rules work can be found <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/rules/">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="layouts">Layouts</h1>

<p>This is just a list of all the layouts we have, the first three the default ones dwm includes, and the rest, the ones we can add by patching. Since they&rsquo;re represented with a string, we can change that to a nice unicode character.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-c">
static const Layout layouts[] = {
    /* symbol       arrange function */
    { "ﴳ",       tile },    /* first entry is default */
    { "缾",      NULL },    /* no layout function means floating behavior */
    { "类",      monocle },
    { "ﰀ",      bstack },
    { "",      bstackhoriz },
    { "",      clean },
};
    </code>
</pre>

<h1 id="keybindings-and-custom-commands">Keybindings and custom commands</h1>

<p>Now this part was pretty straightforward and can be done on a vanilla dwm. Before going into the patches, I&rsquo;ll describe one of the most powerful customizations: keybindings. dwm can launch applications with flags and the like, and understanding how to add your own besides the default ones goes a long way to boot your <del>laziness</del> productivity.</p>

<p>First, we define our command as a pointer to an array of strings, give it the name we want, and give each flag and parameter it&rsquo;s own place. Finally, we add a <code>NULL</code> at the end to indicate that there are no more commands left. For example, I&rsquo;ve created this to allow me to rise the volume.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-c">
static const char *volupcmd[] = { "amixer", "-q", "set", "Master", "5%+", NULL };
    </code>
</pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">static const char *volupcmd[] = { &quot;amixer&quot;, &quot;-q&quot;, &quot;set&quot;, &quot;Master&quot;, &quot;5%+&quot;, NULL };
</code></pre>

<p>nice</p>
