      <description>My experience with dwm started as an interest in tiling window managers - had previously tried i3, but never got comfortable with the keybindings. When I found about the whole suckless project, the idea of a simpler WM that offered tiling and was very light made me interested in trying it on an older netbook I had.
Since I had no clue on how to patch it, found an interesting fork on github that had some patches I was interested in.</description>
