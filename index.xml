      <title>Adventures in Go: Writing a TUI, Part 1 - tview</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding in Go quite often for the last new months, and it has certainly become my favorite programming language. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve made a small music tag editor, a variation of a hangman game, a little music scheduler, and was trying to build a dotfile manager but that didn&amp;rsquo;t go too far.
And in the process I&amp;rsquo;ve actually learned a lot about making TUIs (Terminual User Interfaces), which prompted me to write this article.</description>

      <title>Void Linux Journey, Part I: Automounting</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I ended up using an obscure GNU/Linux distro such as Void - after finally managing to install Arch with XFCE, and realizing that all the hard work was only beginning, I deleted and kept using MX Linux for a few months more. Then winter holidays came, and thought it was finally time to stop admiring all those wonderful setups from r/unixporn and make my own!</description>

      <title>How to dwm</title>

      <description>My experience with dwm started as an interest in tiling window managers - had previously tried i3, but never got comfortable with the keybindings. When I found about the whole suckless project, the idea of a simpler WM that offered tiling and was very light made me interested in trying it on an older netbook I had.
Since I had no clue on how to patch it, found an interesting fork on github that had some patches I was interested in.</description>
